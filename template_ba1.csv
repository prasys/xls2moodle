Neural Network,Pradeesh,2023,The term Deep learning refers to: ,"Neural networks with at least one hidden layer, sometimes many more. ",Neural networks with many nodes per layer. ,All neural networks that are trained for a long time. ,Random forest ,1,"2,3,4",
Neural Network,Pradeesh,2023,Artificial Neural Networks can perform: ,Classification,Both classification and regression ,Regression,Abstract thought ,2,"1,3,4",
Neural Network,Pradeesh,2023,Which is correct? Artificial neural networks: ,"Have two or more layers, each of which contains many nodes. ","Have two or more nodes, each of which contains many layers. ",Can hide layers from the programmer ,Only have two edges ,1,"2,3,4",
Neural Network,Pradeesh,2023,Which is correct? Edges: ,Connect nodes to one another ,Are nodes that are at the edge of layers ,Are layers that are at the front or end of the neural network ,Hide layers from the programmer ,1,"2,3,4",
Neural Network,Pradeesh,2023,Which is correct?  ,"It is obvious which activation function to use, before starting training. ",There are only two activation functions available: ReLu and tanh. ,Activation functions determine if data flows from one node to another. ,Sigmoid is always the first activation function you should try. ,3,"1,2,4",
Neural Network,Pradeesh,2023,Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a: ,Variation of gradient descent particularly suited for training large neural networks. ,Type of node,Variation of labels for neural networks ,An activation function ,2,"1,3,4",
Neural Network,Pradeesh,2023,Optimisers in deep learning: ,Are the same optimisers as classical machine learning ,Reverse back propagation to improve activation functions ,Are mostly variations of SGD ,Adjust node structure ,3,"1,2,4",
Neural Network,Pradeesh,2023,For input layers of neural networks ,The size of the input layer should match the number of features ,The input layer is better decided by Keras / TensorFlow ,The input layer should match the labels ,"The input layer should be dynamic, fast, and adaptable. ",1,"2,3,4",
Neural Network,Pradeesh,2023,For multi-class classification using Neural Networks: ,The activation function of the output layer should be softmax ,The activation function of the output layer should be sigmoid ,The output layer should output a numerical label ,The input layer should match the output layer ,1,"2,3,4",
Neural Network,Pradeesh,2023,Callbacks are: ,are code that can be run at the end of a training epoch ,A type of optimiser that adjusts weights as needed ,A test set ,A way to optimise your training data ,4,"1,2,3",
